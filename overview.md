# Project Overview:
A Kubernetes Operator project called Service Function Chaining (SFC) Operator. This operator is designed to manage service function chains (SFC) in a Kubernetes environment. The purpose of the project is to enable the orchestration and management of service function chains, which are typically used for network service chaining, such as in telecommunications, to ensure that traffic flows through a series of network services in a specific order.

The operator manages the lifecycle of Service Functions and Service Function Chains, enforcing policies and ensuring proper coordination between different resources.

## Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs):
You have several key CRDs defined for this project, each with its own specific responsibility:

### ServiceFunction:

Purpose: Represents a single service function, which can be a containerized service running inside a Kubernetes pod.

Spec: Contains information like the image to use for the service function, ports, and node selector.

Status: Indicates the name of the pod running the service function and whether it is ready.

### ServiceFunctionChain:

Purpose: Represents a chain of service functions that need to be applied in sequence. The chain defines the order and relationship between multiple service functions.

Spec: Contains a list of service function names that should be executed in the defined order.

Status: Tracks the deployed service functions and whether the chain is ready.

### SFCPolicy:

Purpose: Represents a policy that applies to a service function chain, determining when and how the policy should be applied based on the status of the chain.

Spec: References the service function chain to which the policy applies.

Status: Tracks whether the policy was successfully applied, based on the readiness of the associated service function chain.

## Controllers:
You have three main controllers, each responsible for the reconciliation of the respective CRDs:

ServiceFunctionController:

Purpose: Ensures that the ServiceFunction objects are properly reconciled, meaning that if a service function is defined, the corresponding pod is created (or updated) to run the service function. It monitors the pod's status and updates the ServiceFunction status accordingly.

ServiceFunctionChainController:

Purpose: Manages the lifecycle of ServiceFunctionChain objects. It tracks the status of the service functions in the chain and updates the ServiceFunctionChain status based on the readiness of the individual service functions in the chain.

SFCPolicyController:

Purpose: Reconciles the SFCPolicy objects. It checks the status of the associated service function chain, and based on its readiness, updates the policy status to indicate whether the policy has been successfully applied.

## General Flow:
ServiceFunction: Each ServiceFunction corresponds to a pod running a specific service. The ServiceFunctionController ensures that the pod is created and running.

ServiceFunctionChain: The ServiceFunctionChainController tracks the overall status of a chain of service functions, ensuring that all functions in the chain are ready before declaring the chain ready.

SFCPolicy: The SFCPolicyController ensures that a policy is applied to the chain based on the readiness of the service function chain and its functions.


In summary, our project orchestrates the deployment and management of service function chains, tracking their readiness and ensuring the correct application of policies based on the current state of the system. This is a valuable tool for networking and telecom environments where services need to be chained together in a specific order and managed through Kubernetes.
